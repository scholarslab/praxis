# Requirements Gathering

We'll begin discussing the requirements and [scope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(project_management%29) for Prism.

* Functional requirements: What features will it have? How might it work? How will we keep up with these?
* Audience: Who are our target users? How would this tool help them or impact their work? How will we reach them?
* Process: What tools, languages, and strategy will we use to build it? Dealing with [scope creep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep).

## Resources

* David McClure, [Public Poetics](http://publicpoetics.org).
* Julie Meloni, N-Dimensional Archives [blog post](http://www.academicsandbox.com/blog/?p=430) and [podcast with commentary](http://www.scholarslab.org/podcasts/julie-meloni-n-dimensional-archives/)
