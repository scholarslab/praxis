The Praxis Program site is collaboratively written and maintained by our
staff, graduate fellows, and visiting scholars. While the site does not
use Wordpress, we have based it extensively on our
Wordpress theme, Labnotes. Both Labnotes and the Praxis Program code
libraries are freely available in our GitHub repositories.
