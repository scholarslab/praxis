# About Praxis

The Praxis Program is a project of the [Scholars'
Lab](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab) at the [University of Virginia
Library](http://lib.virginia.edu/). In its first two pilot years
(2011-2013), it was generously funded by a grant from the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation to the [Scholarly Communication
Institute](http://uvasci.org). The third year of Praxis, now underway, is wholly supported by the University of Virginia Library.

Praxis is a [radical re-imagining](http://chronicle.com/article/A-Digital-Boot-Camp-for-Grad/131665/) of the annual teaching and training we offer
in the Scholars' Lab, and is meant to complement our work over the past seven years with Scholars' Lab [Graduate
Fellows in Digital
Humanities](http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/about/fellowship.html).

The Praxis Program funds a team of six University of Virginia graduate students from
a variety of disciplines to apprentice with us each academic year. Under
the guidance of Scholars' Lab faculty and staff, they design and create a full-fledged digital humanities project or software tool. The first two cohorts of Praxis worked on [*Prism*](http://prism.scholarslab.org), a platform for "crowd-sourcing" textual analysis,
visualization, and humanities interpretation. The third Praxis cohort is re-imagining and re-creating a defunct University of Virginia SpecLab project, the Ivanhoe Game.

[Recognizing](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/it-starts-on-day-one/37893) that up-to-date methodological training is often absent or
catch-as-catch-can for humanities graduate students, we see the early 
years of the Praxis Program as an opportunity to experiment with an action-oriented curriculum
*live and in public.*  We situate our program in a
[larger conversation](http://uvasci.org/activities-2012-2013/) about the changing demands of the humanities in a digital
age. 

To that end, and with the support of the Scholarly Communication
Institute, we have also forged an international [Praxis Network](http://praxis-network.org) of model
programs taking different approaches to the problem of methodological
training in the humanities.

The Praxis Program aims to equip knowledge workers for emerging faculty
positions and [alternative academic
careers](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac) at a moment in which
new questions can be asked and new systems built. We share our evolving
curriculum and our staff and students alike are [blogging about their
experience](http://www.scholarslab.org/tag/praxis-program/).

We invite you to follow our work in progress, and to cheer on this year's cohort of
thoughtful digital scholars and scholar-practitioners, as they become comfortable designing effective user
experiences; writing and working with open source code; engaging broad
audiences; managing teams and budgets; and theorizing their work within the
rich tradition of humanities computing.
