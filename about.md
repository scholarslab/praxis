The Praxis Program is a project of the [Scholars'
Lab](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia
Library](http://lib.virginia.edu/). In its first two pilot years
(2011-2013), it was generously funded by a grant from the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation to the [Scholarly Communication
Institute](http://uvasci.org). Praxis is now fully supported by the University of Virginia Library.

Praxis is a [radical re-imagining](http://chronicle.com/article/A-Digital-Boot-Camp-for-Grad/131665/) of the annual teaching and training we offer
in the Scholars' Lab, and is meant to complement our work with the Scholars' Lab [Graduate
Fellows in Digital Humanities](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/for-students/).

The Praxis Program funds a team of University of Virginia graduate students from
a variety of disciplines to apprentice with us each academic year. Praxis training takes a variety of shapes meant to reflect the full-range of DH work.  As a part of their training with us, student cohorts regularly publish a range of [values statements](https://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/) describing the intentional communities they want to build together. They also design and teach [digital humanities workshops](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/visiting-workshops-at-washington-and-lee-university/) based on their own interests as a means to exercise minimalist pedagogical approaches to DH. Students design speculative projects and events that might go on to be implemented by the Lab. They also participate in a range of technical and design activities meant to reflect the range of digital practices they will encounter in their research. At times, Praxis teams have developed and launched specific, named [projects](https://praxis.scholarslab.org/projects/).

[Recognizing](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/it-starts-on-day-one/37893) that up-to-date methodological training is often absent or
catch-as-catch-can for humanities graduate students, we see the early
years of the Praxis Program as an opportunity to experiment with an action-oriented curriculum
*live and in public.*  We situate our program in a
[larger conversation](http://uvasci.org/activities-2012-2013/) about the changing demands of the humanities in a digital
age.

To that end, and with the support of the Scholarly Communication
Institute, we have also forged an international [Praxis Network](http://praxis-network.org) of model
programs taking different approaches to the problem of methodological
training in the humanities.

The Praxis Program aims to equip knowledge workers for emerging faculty
positions and [alternative academic
careers](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac) at a moment in which
new questions can be asked and new systems built. We share our evolving
curriculum and our staff and students alike are [blogging about their
experience](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/).

We invite you to follow our work in progress, and to cheer on this year's cohort of
thoughtful digital scholars and scholar-practitioners, as they become comfortable designing effective user
experiences; writing and working with open source code; engaging broad
audiences; managing teams and budgets; and theorizing their work within the
rich tradition of humanities computing.
