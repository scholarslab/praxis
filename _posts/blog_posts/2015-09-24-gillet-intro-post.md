Gillet is a PhD candidate in the history department with an interest in race and culture in the 20th century United States. Her dissertation examines the meaning of the home in the context of late twentieth century public housing. As someone who studies change over time, she very much looks forward to questioning the linear and causal understanding of time that undergirds history as a discipline with her fellow cohort members. She is excited to learn from her cohort and see what this exploration of time brings!
