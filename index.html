    <h1>Time tracking and JavaScript</h1>
    <p>What are we working on? This week we are continuing to work on JavaScript, learning on our own and also with the help of the folks at the SLab. We are also finishing our experiential time reflections, each of us running our own experiment on how we value and structure our time in our daily lives. You can check out our memos/posts for more details on what everyone is up to - we should have some final reflective thoughts on it up next week.

    <p>The Praxis Program reimagines graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to equip knowledge workers for positions within and beyond the academy at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who can reach new audiences and are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets.</p>
