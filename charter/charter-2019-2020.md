# 2019-2020 Praxis Program Charter

## Goals
###### GROUP GOALS
* Process over outcome/final product; focus on this experience being a multi-dimensional learning process for everyone; provide space for different types of learning/tinkering
* Develop a knowledge of the types of technologies used in the digital humanities and develop skills to engage with them critically and creatively
* Teach a workshop to share our (newly acquired) knowledge
* Blog to document the process
* Create something that is widely accessible to a broad community

###### INDIVIDUAL GOALS
* Chloe:
     * Learn how to better share and visualize information in order to contribute to the field and benefit a wider public
     * Build fundamental technical skills, including coding, as well as an understanding of the breadth and possibilities of the digital humanities
     * Learn to think more creatively and be more experimental as a scholar
* Connor:
     * Embrace the SLab philosophy of learning by doing (such as coding!)
     * Shed any lingering traces of “I’m not a tech person” mentality
     * Learn more about the possibilities of using digital tools to analyze and present sound
* Janet:
    * Learn to code (new languages to communicate)
    * Learn about data visualization
    * Learn new perspectives, stay open, and reflect more
    * Learn more about the digital humanities, in particular how the digital humanities are deployed to expand and improve access to information for a diverse audience
    * Practice collaborative work to learn more about myself (my work needs, interests, and motivations)
    * Manage data well
    * Own the method and knowledge and work; better understand the interconnectedness of technical and intellectual processes
* Lauren:
    * Integrate exploratory questions and methodologies into my process--create space for play, innovation, and new ways of thinking
    * Make space for more collaborative and/or public-oriented work in my own work
    * Learn how to hack & yack -- expand my understanding of DH beyond its use as a tool to include how it also might inspire
* Natasha:
    * Learn the potential in DH for democratizing access to archives and archival material, scholarly research, and other resources from the academy
    * Learn the basics of coding, in a way that will facilitate further exposure to digital tools post-Praxis
    * Stay curious!
    * Be part of SLab community

## Values
###### COLLABORATION
* Communication
    * Needs for help, more time, scheduling, etc. → check-ins to facilitate these (see also Living Charter Management)
    * Openness and honesty about individual interests, expectations of participation, expectations about the project, and any issues that may arise
    * Be cognizant of representing individual ideas versus those of the group
* Come together and work as ‘whole people’
    * Acknowledge that we each come from and participate in multiple, different communities and roles
    * Generosity, Patience, & Trust: an understanding that other obligations exist but that we all maintain a commitment to the charter and project
    * Compassionate collaboration and learning environment. Question, rather than reject ideas, to keep conversation open. “Yes, and...” 
    * Growth-oriented process: pause to learn from obstacles/setbacks and move forward with curiosity
* Credit
    * Give credit within the group; build each other up and give affirmation along the way
        * When writing or presenting about the project in a public setting, give credit to the entire group by listing all names in alphabetical order and specify each individual’s role when appropriate; in non-public settings, acknowledgement of the project as a group collaboration is sufficient
    * Give credit to those contributing from outside the group
* Consensus 
    * We will strive for consensus when making decisions. If voting becomes necessary, we will use ⅗ majority

###### ACCOUNTABILITY
* Transparency 
    * Acknowledgement or confrontation of our own biases and positions of privilege as individuals and members of a larger institution
* Create widely accessible work for a broad community, extending beyond academia
* Responsibilities of our roles/work
    * Incorporate liberationist (e.g. feminist, anti-racist, anti-xenophobic) values in our products and processes—be cognizant of whose work we’re using/citing; be careful about assuming objectivity, and don’t shy away from subjectivity
    * Amplify the work of others—make sure we’re not duplicating or replicating work that is already out there, especially when it’s been done by grassroots/marginalized/underfunded institutions or individuals
    * Define which groups we want to serve, and have a regular ‘health check’ to make sure we’re serving them
    * Have an inclusive rather than exclusive policy—invite in new voices and/or information from local communities

###### FUN & PLAY
* Be playful, curious, and celebrate small victories
* Let the process be driven by our interests and desire to experiment
* Stay open to new ideas and endpoints, as we experiment/learn new information or processes
* Come together outside of the Scholars’ Lab and be human

## Living Charter Management
* Agree that we won’t have all the answers for every scenario now → First Tuesday of each month: lunch meeting to discuss what’s going well or what needs adjustment
* When we do have a better idea of the project and its requirements, to come together to discuss milestones, work progress, and potential platforms for our work
* …
