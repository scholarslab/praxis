## We each came to [Praxis](http://praxis.scholarslab.org.) with specific *wishes* & *hopes*:

**SARAH:** “During the Praxis 2016/17 fellowship I hope to learn about key concepts in the digital humanities, and to enhance my skill set in a collaborative environment.  It is my goal to learn more about tools and methodologies in this field, while working together with colleagues from other departments and learning about different areas of the humanities.”

**JORDAN:** “My goal for Praxis is to make something that will be accessible and useful. I want our design choices to reflect our diverse theoretical insights as much as what we’ve learned about web design. I hope to expand my understanding of what the digital humanities has to offer the academy between and among disciplines, and to learn to manage and implement a large-scale team project. Finally, I hope to work towards a project that will sustain and reward continued development after the conclusion of the fellowship.”

**ALICIA:** “My goal for Praxis is to promote an academic environment that takes the issue of imposter syndrome head on. The Chronicle of Higher Ed and other academia-centered media outlets discuss imposter syndrome ad nauseam, and yet the subject is completely ignored on the ground in everyday life in the university. I hope to have this be a conversation that we have throughout the semester as we learn to collaborate with other academics on a joint project. The dream would be to take these lessons and experiences back to our departments, and open up dialogues with our peers, students, and advisors and begin to change academic culture from within.”

**JOSEPH:** “I have three main goals for my time in Praxis. First, I want to learn how to be transparent and collaborative with my work. This means being honest about my learning process and open to teamwork. Second, I want to learn how to use interdisciplinary skills in ways that engage with audiences outside of academia. The ability to reach a wide public audience offers one of the most exciting features about the digital humanities. Last, I hope Praxis will offer a fun and relaxed space to do this work, and I hope to contribute to that at all times.”

**ALYSSA:** "My myriad goals for Praxis might be boiled down to three “actions”:
* To *incorporate* making, experimentation, and transparency into my own academic practice
* To *collaborate*!  
* To *theorize* the ways in which the digital affects embodied experiences. I’m excited to work with my cohort to think through (by way of building) the ways that the technological spaces we create and inhabit intersect with our lived experiences as represented through conversations we have about race, class, and gender.”

**JUSTIN:** “I hope Praxis 2016/17 contributes to a vision of a more extroverted academy. As we develop a tool for the digital humanities, I hope we will also consider how our practice resonates with current events, reach audiences beyond the university, and look for ways to take action in the public sphere.”

## We also share common *goals*:

Some of them relate to things that will happen along the way. Others concern the final product, or the DH tool we will create and present at the end of the 2016/17 school year.
