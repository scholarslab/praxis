Workshop Teaching Statement with Ashley Hosbach **Confirmed**

If Time Allows
* Timed writing prompts on DH pedagogy

*Pre-Readings*
* Sean Michael Morris, [Technology is not Pedagogy](https://www.seanmichaelmorris.com/technology-is-not-pedagogy/), [Say No to Best Practices](https://www.seanmichaelmorris.com/saying-no-to-best-practices/), [On Silence: Humanising Digital Pedagogy](https://www.seanmichaelmorris.com/on-silence-humanising-digital-pedagogy/) - Sean talks mostly in the context of online learning in these pieces, so abstract them a tad to be applicable to digital methods and teaching more generally.
* [One Concept: Ten Ways to Teach](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/one-concept-ten-ways-to-teach/)
