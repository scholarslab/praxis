2:00-3:30 - attend Victoria Szabo talk in the lab.

*Pre-Work*
* Draft a second blog post
* Come prepared to talk about your research
interests for 10-15 minutes (if you have DH areas that interest you that's great but the point will be to guide you towards things to follow up on throughout the year)
