title: Hackathon Pre-Discussion
---

Full Session
* Discuss hackathon interests

*Pre-Work*
* Given your shared interests, come to the session with some sense of what your object of study will be to explore it during the hackathon. What will your materials be? Are they accessible? What decisions can you make to help have a more concrete idea of what you'll work on? Could come with 1-3 things as options–things to study, to share, to remix, to work on–and we help narrow. You will come out of the session with a data source, object of study, or thing of interest that you'll then play around with over the winter in preparation for first steps in the spring.
* Make appointments with each other to peer review your workshops or statements.
