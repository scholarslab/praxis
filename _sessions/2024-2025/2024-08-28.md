**Praxis and the plan for the year, Brandon**
* [Scholars’ Lab charter](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/charter/)
* [Scholars’ Lab student program charter](http://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/student-programs-charter/)
* [Praxis Program charter](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/) - (overlaps a lot with the previous one, so I’d just look for the different bits)
* [A Digital Boot Camp for Grad Students in the Humanities](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Digital-Boot-Camp-for-Grad/131665/) by former SLab director Bethany Nowviskie
* [The Shape of DH Work](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/the-shape-of-dh-work/) by Brandon Walsh
