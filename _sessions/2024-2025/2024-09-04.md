*Pre-Readings Pt 1*

* Miriam Posner, [Here and There: Creating DH Community](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/c6b8f952-acfd-48b6-82bb-71580c54cad2#ch22)
* Bethany Nowviskie, [Capacity Through Care](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/3a53cbc1-5eee-421a-a4f6-82bb5dfb1c17#ch37)
* Roopika Risam, [Navigating the Global Digital Humanities: Insights from Black Feminism](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/4316ff92-bad0-45e8-8f09-90f493c6f564#ch29)
* [Colored Convention Project Principles](https://coloredconventions.org/about/principles/) (might be helpful to poke around the site to see what the project is as well, since the principles don't explicitly state as much)
* Brandon and Amanda, [Building Community And Generosity In The Context Of Graduate Education](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/building-community-and-generosity-in-the-context-of-graduate-education/) - Also be sure to check out and peruse the three readings/tools linked in the "practices section"

*Pre-Readings pt 2*
* Other Praxis cohort charters, available on the Praxis site - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/). Explore to your heart’s content, but they repeat each other a fair amount. So no need to go overboard - I might pick one or two.
* And then, if you have time, you might check out one or two of the resources here - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/). Those are all related to charter development and very worthwhile. Explore at your interest, but the Collaborators’ Bill of Rights and Bethany’s piece are probably the most widely cited.
* [DevDH](http://devdh.org/)- there is a ton there, no need to look at everything. You might just take a look at one or two things and only do a deeper dive if you're interested.
* Praxis Alum Blog posts. Make sure you read them in order, as they respond to one another. There was also some discussion in the comments that got lost when we shifted platforms, but you'll get the idea.
* "[…but I don't like programming](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/but-i-dont-like-programming-gender-and-our-division-of-labor/)," Claire Maiers
* "[Gendering Praxis](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/gendering-praxis/)," Cecilia Márquez
* "[Gender and computing ctd](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/gender-and-computing-ctd/)," Shane Lin
