[Code lab](https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab/tree/master/Week01) Fundamentals: Introduction

*Pre-Readings*
* [Paul Ford, What is Code?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
* [Benjamin Schmidt, Do Digital Humanists Need to Understand Algorithms?](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/557c453b-4abb-48ce-8c38-a77e24d3f0bd#ch48) - Don't get caught up in the technical details; there's absolutely no need to understand a Fourier Transform in any depth.

*Homework*
* Schedule a 1 on 1 with me in the next 2 weeks to talk about your dreams, your discontents, and your computer. We'll also use this time to set up your [development environment](https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab/blob/master/Week01/environment_setup.md). 
* Afterward, complete Ian Milligan and James Baker, "Introduction to the Bash Command Line," The Programming Historian 3 (2014), [https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash). This is an introduction to the Bash shell, which will serve well enough as an introduction to other shells like Zsh as well.
  * For Windows users, skip the "Windows Only: Installing Git Bash" section. Instead, use the VSCode Terminal or Windows Terminal, as recommended in the Code Lab environment setup.
* Set up an account at [Github](http://www.github.com) and post your username on the Slack praxis channel so I can add you to our organization.
* Hopefully I'll have passed out copies of Julia Evans's lovely [So You Want to be a Wizard](https://wizardzines.com/zines/wizard/) zine. That's something written for someone who is already a programmer, but it'll be useful for you to skim through now to gleen some meta-strategies for navigating tech. Review it again once you have a few for loops under your belt.
* For a bit of counter-programming, Miriam Posner's ["Some things to think about before you exhort everyone to code"](https://miriamposner.com/blog/some-things-to-think-about-before-you-exhort-everyone-to-code/) is good to think about (and perhaps even to critique).
