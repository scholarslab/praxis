Round 1 - Archives (Jeremy - **Confirmed**), Texts (Alison - **Confirmed**)

* Draft a first blog post; consider introducing yourself or take any other topic you wish.
* If you want to take the route of pitching/submitting a formal piece of writing to an outlet this year let Brandon know and make a time to talk about plans.

## 3pm-4pm

Design jam student interests; come prepared to talk about your research interests for 10-15 minutes (if you have DH areas that interest you that's great but the point will be to guide you towards things to follow up on throughout the year)
