title: Hackathon Conversation
---

**2-4pm**

* Pre-work: get together as a group to compare your interests. Can you find a common place where they overlap? Not thinking objects of study or materials at this point - those will come later. Just subjects/topics. We'll discuss and help narrow as a group. We'll open with students presenting to the staff on it.
* Shane will also share a small bit about what a hackathon is, what our goals are for you, etc.
