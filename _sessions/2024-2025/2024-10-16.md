title: Hackathon Conversation
---

Full session
* Shane will also share a small bit about what a hackathon is, what our goals are for you, etc.
* Discuss hackathon ideas

*Pre-work* 
* Get together as a group to compare your interests. Can you find a common place where they overlap? Not thinking objects of study or materials at this point - those will come later. Just subjects/topics. We'll discuss and help narrow as a group. We'll open with students presenting to the staff on their shared interests.
