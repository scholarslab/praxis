title: Hackathon Conversation
---

Full session
* Shane will also share a small bit about what a hackathon is, what our goals are for you, etc.
* Discuss hackathon ideas

*Pre-work* 
* Get together as a group to compare your interests. Can you find a common place where they overlap? Not thinking objects of study or materials at this point - those will come later. Just subjects/topics. We'll discuss and help narrow as a group. We'll open with students presenting to the staff on their shared interests. Try to come with ten points of intersection and commonality if you can, organized by how passionate you are about them.
