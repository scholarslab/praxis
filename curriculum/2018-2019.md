# Praxis Schedule 2018-2019

Praxis meets officially for two hours once a week during the academic year. The following schedule represents a projection of what the content of those weekly meetings will be. Each session is projected to be roughly 60 minutes long, which will allow plenty of time for flexibility and conversation with the group before and after.

This year we broke out the technical components into a third hour at the suggestion of Zoe. This coding track ran concurrently throughout the year, and the extra contact hour gave us a chance to go further with the students.

Code lab curriculum - [https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab](https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab)

### Fall - 14 weeks

August 28 - December 7

Three assignments - charter, workshop, grant/project proposal.
Goal is to have them develop a portfolio of things at the end of the year both individually and as a group.

* Week 1
  * Friday, September 7th from 1-3 – Brown 133
    * Digital Pedagogy and Praxis, Brandon; Framing of charter assignment **All folks booked**
    * Readings assigned
      * [Scholars’ Lab charter](http://scholarslab.org/about/charter)
      * [Scholars’ Lab student program charter](http://scholarslab.org/student-programs-charter/)
      * [Praxis Program charter](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/) - (overlaps a lot with the previous one, so I’d just look for the different bits)
      * [A Digital Boot Camp for Grad Students in the Humanities](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Digital-Boot-Camp-for-Grad/131665/) by former SLab director Bethany Nowviskie
* Week 2
  * Tuesday, September 11th from 11-12 in Alderman 423
    * Code camp 1 - intro to computation; intro to bash; pep talk
  * Friday, September 14th from 1-3 – Brown 133
    * Brandon Butler visit to frame public domain toolkit project; Intro to Charters, Ronda; **All folks booked**
    * Readings assigned
      * Public domain day brief intro that Brandon Butler put together (circulated by email)
      * Other Praxis cohort charters, available on the Praxis site - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/). Explore to your heart’s content, but they repeat each other a fair amount. So no need to go overboard - I might pick one or two.
      * And then, if you have time, you might check out one or two of the resources here - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/). Those are all related to charter development and very worthwhile. Explore at your interest, but the Collaborators’ Bill of Rights and Bethany’s piece are probably the most widely cited.
