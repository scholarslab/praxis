# Praxis Schedule 2019-2020

Praxis meets officially for three hours once a week during the academic year. The following schedule represents a projection of what the content of those weekly meetings will be. Each session is projected to be roughly 60-120 minutes long, which will allow plenty of time for flexibility and conversation with the group before and after.

Meetings will be the Scholars' Lab fellows lounge. In general, Praxis will follow the schedule of the academic calendar. So first meetings will be the first week of classes, we will observe holidays and reading days, and we'll end the last week of classes.

Code lab curriculum - [https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab](https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab)

### Fall - 14 weeks - August 27 - December 6

Three assignments - charter, workshop, grant/project proposal.
Goal is to have them develop a portfolio of things at the end of the year both individually and as a group.

      * [Praxis Program charter](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/) - (overlaps a lot with the previous one, so I’d just look for the different bits)
      * [A Digital Boot Camp for Grad Students in the Humanities](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Digital-Boot-Camp-for-Grad/131665/) by former SLab director Bethany Nowviskie

    * Readings Assigned
      * Other Praxis cohort charters, available on the Praxis site - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/). Explore to your heart’s content, but they repeat each other a fair amount. So no need to go overboard - I might pick one or two.
      * And then, if you have time, you might check out one or two of the resources here - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/). Those are all related to charter development and very worthwhile. Explore at your interest, but the Collaborators’ Bill of Rights and Bethany’s piece are probably the most widely cited.
