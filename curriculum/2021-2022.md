# Praxis Schedule 2021-2022

Praxis meets officially for three hours once a week during the academic year. The following schedule represents a projection of what the content of those weekly meetings will be. Each session is projected to be roughly 60-120 minutes long.

Meetings will be online in fall 2021. In general, Praxis will follow the schedule of the academic calendar. So first meetings will be the first week of classes, we will observe holidays and reading days, and we'll end each semester the last week of classes.

Code lab curriculum - [https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab](https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab)

Slides -

* [Introduction to Praxis](/assets/orientation-and-praxis.pptx)
* [Workshop on Workshops](/assets/workshop-on-workshops/workshop-on-workshops.pptx)
  * [Accompanying Sentiment Analysis Passages](/assets/workshop-on-workshops/sentiment-analysis-passages.docx)
* [Mind Mapping Your Pedagogy](/assets/mind-mapping-your-pedagogy.pptx)
* [Writing about Pedagogy](/assets/writing-about-pedagogy.key)

### Fall - 15 weeks - August 23 - December 8

Our standard time together is generally going to be Monday from 1-2 EST and Wednesdays from 1-3 EST, with 1-2 being Codelab. We'll be on zoom at least for the fall.

Three assignments - charter, workshop, grant/project proposal.

Goal is to have you develop a portfolio of things at the end of the year both individually and as a group.

* Week 1
  * Monday, August 23, 2021 from 1-2
    * "Praxis - or, what you're in for" and framing of charter assignment, Brandon
    * Readings assigned
      * [Scholars’ Lab charter](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/charter/)
      * [Scholars’ Lab student program charter](http://scholarslab.org/student-programs-charter/)
      * [Praxis Program charter](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/) - (overlaps a lot with the previous one, so I’d just look for the different bits)
      * [A Digital Boot Camp for Grad Students in the Humanities](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Digital-Boot-Camp-for-Grad/131665/) by former SLab director Bethany Nowviskie
  * Wednesday, August 25, 2021 from 1-2  (Shane will run assuming he has returned. Otherwise Brandon will cover)
    * [Code lab](https://github.com/scholarslab/codelab) - pep talk
    * Readings assigned (optional):
      * [Paul Ford, What is Code?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
      * [Benjamin Schmidt, Do Digital Humanists Need to Understand Algorithms?](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/557c453b-4abb-48ce-8c38-a77e24d3f0bd#ch48) - Don't get caught up in the technical details; there's absolutely no need to understand a Fourier Transform in any depth.
      * [Ian Milligan and James Baker, Introduction to the Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash) - All of you are using MacOS (or Linux), so this should be fairly straightforward. If you've switched to a Windows (or other) machine, please let me know because that could be a bit messier.
  * Wednesday, August 25, 2021 from 2-3
    * Conversation about Collaboration and Community, Brandon and Amanda **Accepted**
    * Readings Assigned
      * Miriam Posner, [Here and There: Creating DH Community](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/c6b8f952-acfd-48b6-82bb-71580c54cad2#ch22)

      * [Colored Convention Project Principles](https://coloredconventions.org/about/principles/) (might be helpful to poke around the site to see what the project is as well, since the principles don't explicitly state as much)
      * Brandon and Amanda, [Building Community And Generosity In The Context Of Graduate Education](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/building-community-and-generosity-in-the-context-of-graduate-education/) - Also be sure to check out and peruse the three readings/tools linked in the "practices section"
* Week 2
  * Monday, August 30, 2021 from 1-2
    * Intro to Charters, Ronda **Tentatively accepted**
    * Readings Assigned
      * Other Praxis cohort charters, available on the Praxis site - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/). Explore to your heart’s content, but they repeat each other a fair amount. So no need to go overboard - I might pick one or two.
      * And then, if you have time, you might check out one or two of the resources here - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/). Those are all related to charter development and very worthwhile. Explore at your interest, but the Collaborators’ Bill of Rights and Bethany’s piece are probably the most widely cited.
      * [DevDH](http://devdh.org/)- there is a ton there, no need to look at everything. You might just take a look at one or two things and only do a deeper dive if you're interested.
      * Praxis Alum Blog posts. Make sure you read them in order, as they respond to one another. There was also some discussion in the comments that got lost when we shifted platforms, but you'll get the idea. -
        * "[…but I don't like programming](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/but-i-dont-like-programming-gender-and-our-division-of-labor/)," Claire Maiers
