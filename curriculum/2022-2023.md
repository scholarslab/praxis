# Praxis Schedule 2022-2023

Praxis meets for three hours weekly during the academic year. Students are expected to put in roughly ten hours of work total each week. 

Praxis follows the schedule of the academic calendar. So first meetings will be the first week of classes, we will observe holidays and reading days, and we'll end each semester the last week of classes.

## Resources 

* Code lab curriculum - [https://github.com//CodeLab](https://github.com//CodeLab)
* [Introduction to Praxis](/assets/orientation-and-praxis.pptx)
* [Workshop on Workshops](/assets/workshop-on-workshops/workshop-on-workshops.pptx)
  * [Accompanying Sentiment Analysis Passages](/assets/workshop-on-workshops/sentiment-analysis-passages.docx)
  * [Quick Python program to run sentiment analysis on a passage](/assets/workshop-on-workshops/sentiment-example.py)
* [Mind Mapping Your Pedagogy](/assets/mind-mapping-your-pedagogy.pptx)
* [Writing about Pedagogy](/assets/writing-about-pedagogy.key)

## Goals and Outcomes

Two tracks running simultaneously: PraxisGeneral and CodeLab

1. PraxisGeneral contains three units: Communities of DH, DH Teaching and Learning, and DH Research and Administration.
2. CodeLab runs yearlong a year and consists of an introduction to humanities programming by way of Python in the fall and a DesignLab in the spring.

Each of these tracks contains a variety of deliverables: 

* A group charter, a statement of values and practices we will adhere to as a community
* A personalized plan for self-study throughout the year meant to take advantage of the resources in the lab
* An individual teaching plan for a DH workshop based around the students' interests
* A DH teaching statement
* A speculative personal project proposal for what comes next for them to be workshopped by the group
* Activities meant to exercise technical and design thinking as they relate to humanities problems
* Spring Hackathon as a group
* Final presentation to a local audience
* Two blog posts

These discussions and outcomes encompass a variety of different definitions of what it means to "do DH." DH is capacious enough that it is quite difficult to design a program that can both introduce a broad range of approaches but also engage individual paths. Accordingly, the outcomes and units offer a mix of individual and group activities, but each student will need to supplement this work with self-study around their particular interests. We frame the year with twin sessions directed at this: in the fall, we spend time with each student design jamming their interests to help design a plan for the year and, in the spring, each student shares back where their interests have developed and next steps for them. 

By the end of the year, students will have a portfolio of experiences and work directed towards the following goals. Students will:

* Practice DH in the following areas using appropriate technologies, methods, and activities:
  * Community building
  * Teaching
  * Research and project design
  * Administration
  * Programming
  * Design
* become capable of pursuing their own interests in the above areas moving forward;
* see digital humanities as a field and career path available to them regardless of their background;
* come to see themselves as experts in digital research with experiences worthy of sharing with others as scholars and teachers;
* and prepare themselves to pay it forward, early and often.

## CodeLab and DesignLab

Description generated by GPT3:

In Codelab, you are a raccoon who is a master of digital humanities heists. You are tasked with stealing data and information from various sources in order to help your criminal organization. You must use your skills of hacking to bypass security measures and get your hands on the valuable data. Be careful though, as you are not the only one after the data. The police and other rival gangs will be hot on your tail. Can you outwit them all and become the ultimate digital humanist?

CodeLab is a semester-long introduction to the foundations programming and computational thinking for Digital Humanities. You will gain experience using a variety of technologies (Python, git/github) relevant to technical work in DH and exercise these new skills with some focused activities relevant to DH work. 

DesignLab is a 10-week primer on critical approaches to design for Digital Humanities work, that includes conceptual and application work in the following areas:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript;
* Information architecture/organization
* Graphic/Visual design elements and concepts
* Accessibility + Usability
* Scoping/Strategizing approaches for design projects;

By the end of this, students should have a better understanding of how to approach design for advocacy and intervention work in Digital Humanities.

## Schedule

### Fall - 15 weeks - August 24 - December 5

Our standard times together are generally going to be Monday from 10-12 and Wednesdays from 10-11 (for CodeLab).

**Unit 1: Communities of Digital Humanities**

What constitutes a community in DH? How will we design one together? How do DHers articulate these practices in public? How do you publish on DH community? And how do you find your way into these communities as individuals just starting out? The cohort will explore these questions by way of a group charter and designing plans for self-study.

**Unit 2: DH Teaching and Learning**

What does teaching and learning look like in Digital Humanities? What politics do we bring to DH pedagogy? What are our own pedagogies, and how can we inflect those in DH? What is a pedagogy anyway? What does publishing look like in DH pedagogy? The cohort will explore these questions in two ways: designing a plan for a DH workshop based around their own interests and drafting a statement of DH teaching and pedagogy.

### Spring - 17 weeks - January 18th - May 2
Meeting Times Tuesdays from 10-12 and Thursdays from 10-11. Design lab concurrently running weeks 2-11

**Unit 3: Research and Administration in DH**

How do you conduct research in DH? How do you design a successful project? What do we mean when we call something a digital project, and how do we define them with an ethos that is meaningful to us? How do infrastructure and administration in the field intersect with DH research, enabling or inhibiting it? How do these questions bring us back around to the beginning of the year, by developing communities and audiences for our work? The students will explore these through project management activities resulting in individual project proposals based on their work as well as speculative activities for DH events. 

Main assignment will be a two-page proposal for a project that you would work on after praxis in the style of a grant application. Try to hit on the following categories (though it's only two pages so each one will be pretty short!):

* Project description
* Literature review
* Technical overview
* Project development timeline
* Outreach/audience strategy
* Sustainability and Copyright
* Budget

We will have in-session consults about each of your proposals, so they will be due the Monday of the week you'll be on deck, in weeks 9-11.

**Unit 4: Next Steps for You**

What has resonated for you this year? What will you pick up and take with you from what we've learned? What comes next for you? What will your DH look like? What conversations do you want to have?
