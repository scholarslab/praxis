# Requirements Gathering

We'll begin discussing the requirements and [scope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(project_management) for Prism.

* Functional requirements: What features will it have? How might it work? How will we keep up with these?
* Audience: Who are our target users? How would this tool help them or impact their work? How will we reach them?
* Process: What tools, languages, and strategy will we use to build it? Dealing with [scope creep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep).
